              <div class="cert-text">
                Bidcas was a technical event with three rounds. The first round tested OOPS concepts, which I cleared successfully. The second round was a debugging challenge, and I qualified for that as well. The final round involved solving a logic-based problem within a time limit, but I couldn't crack it. Despite this, I networked with many tech-savvy students and got to revise and practice OOPS concepts. The event was a great learning experience, helping me identify areas for improvement and grow as a programmer.

                I recently participated in Infinity Quest, an exciting event that combined technical challenges with fun-based activities. The event had multiple rounds, each designed to test different skills. Some rounds were technical, focusing on problem-solving and coding, while others were fun-based, encouraging creativity and teamwork. I gave my best in every round, enjoying the mix of learning and entertainment. Though I didn't win, the experience was incredibly rewarding. It helped me improve my technical skills, think creatively, and connect with like-minded participants. Infinity Quest was a memorable event, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to be part of it!

              <div class="cert-text">
                I recently attended a hackathon workshop on AWS, led by Anmoldeep Singh Arora. The session was highly informative and hands-on, focusing on key AWS services like EC2, S3, Lambda, and CloudFormation. Anmoldeep's expertise and practical approach made complex concepts easy to understand. We worked on real-world scenarios, deploying applications and managing cloud infrastructure. The workshop not only enhanced my AWS skills but also inspired me to explore cloud computing further. It was a great learning experience, and I'm excited to apply these skills in future projects!

                I recently participated in my first hackathon, where I applied the AWS skills I learned from Anmoldeep Singh Arora's workshop. It was an incredible experienceâ€”I worked on building and deploying a cloud-based solution using services like EC2, S3, and Lambda. While I didn't win, I don't see it as a failure. Instead, it was a huge learning opportunity. I gained hands-on experience, collaborated with a team, and tackled real-world challenges. For my first hackathon, I'm proud of how far I came and the knowledge I gained. It has motivated me to keep improving and participating in more such events in the future!
